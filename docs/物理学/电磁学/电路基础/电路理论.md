# 电路理论

## 线性电路

A **linear circuit** is one whose output is, linearly related (or directly proportional) to its input.

$$
\begin{aligned}
kiR &= kv\\[8pt]
v &= (i_1+i_2)R=i_1R+i_2R=v_1+v_2
\end{aligned}
$$

## 叠加原理

The **superposition principle** states that the voltage across (or current through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through) that element due to each independent source acting alone.

## 源变换

A **source transformation** is the process of replacing a voltage source v<sub>s</sub> in series with a resistor R by a current source i<sub>s</sub> in parallel with a resistor R, or vice versa.

$$
v_s = i_s R \quad \text{ or } \quad i_s = \frac{v_s}{R}
$$

## 戴维南定理

**Thevenin's theorem** states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source V<sub>th</sub> in series with a resistor R<sub>th</sub>, where V<sub>th</sub> is the open-circuit voltage at the terminals and R<sub>th</sub> is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.

## 诺顿定理

**Norton's theorem** states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source I<sub>N</sub> in parallel with a resistor R<sub>N</sub>, where I<sub>N</sub> is the short-circuit current through the terminals and R<sub>N</sub> is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_N &= R_{Th} \\[8pt]
I_N &= \frac{V_{Th}}{R_{Th}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 最大功率传输

**Maximum power** is transferred to the load when the load resistance equals the Thevenin resistance as seen from the load (R<sub>L</sub> = R<sub>Th</sub>).

$$
\begin{aligned}
p &= i^2 R_L = \left(\frac{V_{Th}}{R_{Th} + R_L}\right)^2 R_L\\[8pt]
\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}R_L} &= V_{Th}^2 \left[\frac{R_{Th} - R_L}{(R_{Th} + R_L)^3}\right] = 0\\[8pt]
\text{thus} \quad R_L &= R_{Th}\\[8pt]
p_{\text{max}} &= \frac{V_{Th}^2}{4R_{Th}}
\end{aligned}
