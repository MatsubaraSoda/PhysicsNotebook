# 基本概念

## 基本定义

An **electric circuit** is an interconnection of electrical elements.

**Charge** is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists, measured in coulombs (C).

$$
e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}
$$

**Electric current** is the time rate of change of charge, measured in amperes (A).

$$
\begin{aligned}
i &\triangleq \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t} \\[8pt]
Q &\triangleq \int_{t_0}^t i\, \mathrm{d}t
\end{aligned}
$$

A **direct current** (dc) flows only in one direction and can be constant or time varying.

An **alternating current** (ac) is a current that changes direction with respect to time.

**Voltage** (or **potential difference**) is the energy required to move a unit charge from a reference point (-) to another point (+), measured in volts (V).

$$
v_{ab} \triangleq \frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}q}
$$

**Power** is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in watts (W).

$$
p \triangleq \frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

or

$$p = \frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}q} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t} = v \cdot i$$

**Passive sign convention** is satisfied when the current enters through the positive terminal of an element and $p=+ v i$. If the current enters through the negative terminal, $p=- v i$.

$$
\Sigma p = 0
$$

**Energy** is the capacity to do work, measured in joules (J).

$$
1 \text{ Wh} = 3600 \text{ J}
$$

An **ideal independent source** is an active element that provides a specified voltage or current that is completely independent of other circuit elements.

An **ideal dependent** (or **controlled**) **source** is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.
1. A voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).
2. A current-controlled voltage source (CCVS).
3. A voltage-controlled current source (VCCS).
4. A current-controlled current source (CCCS).

## 基本定律

$$
R = \rho \frac{l}{A}
$$

**Ohm's law** states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly proportional to the current i flowing through the resistor.

$$
v = iR
$$

The **resistance** R of an element denotes its ability to resist the flow of electric current; it is measured in ohms (Ω).

$$
R = \frac{v}{i}
$$

A **short circuit** is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero.

$$
v = i R = 0
$$

An **open circuit** is a circuit element with resistance approaching infinity.

$$
i = \lim_{R \to \infty} \frac{v}{R} = 0
$$

**Conductance** is the ability of an element to conduct electric current; it is measured in mhos (℧) or siemens (S).

$$
G = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{i}{v}
$$

A **branch** represents a single element such as a voltage source or a resistor.

A **node** is the point of connection of two or more branches.

A **loop** is any closed path in a circuit.

$$
b = l + n - 1
$$

Two or more elements are in **series** if they exclusively share a single node and consequently carry the same current.
Two or more elements are in **parallel** if they are connected to the same two nodes and consequently have the same voltage across them.

**Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)** states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero.

$$
\Sigma_{n=1}^{N} i_n = 0
$$

**Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)** states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed path (or loop) is zero.

$$
\Sigma_{m=1}^{M} v_m = 0
$$

The **equivalent resistance** of any number of resistors connected in series is the sum of the individual resistances.

$$
R_{eq} = \Sigma_{n=1}^{N} R_n
$$

The **equivalent conductance** of any number of resistors connected in parallel is the sum of the individual conductances.

$$
G_{eq} = \Sigma_{n=1}^{N} G_n
$$

## Wye-Delta Transformations

Each resistor in the Y network is the product of the resistors in the two adjacent Δ branches, divided by the sum of the three Δ resistors.

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_1 = \frac{R_b R_c}{R_a + R_b + R_c}\\[8pt]
R_2 = \frac{R_a R_c}{R_a + R_b + R_c}\\[8pt]
R_3 = \frac{R_a R_b}{R_a + R_b + R_c}
\end{aligned}
$$

Each resistor in the Δ network is the sum of all possible products of Y resistors taken two at a time, divided by the opposite Y resistor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_a = \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_1}\\[8pt]
R_b = \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_2}\\[8pt]
R_c = \frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_3}
\end{aligned}
$$

The Y and Δ networks are said to be *balanced* when

$$
R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R_Y,\qquad R_a = R_b = R_c = R_\Delta
$$

Under these conditions, conversion formulas become

$$
R_Y = \frac{R_\Delta}{3}\qquad \text{or} \qquad R_\Delta = 3R_Y
$$

**Nodal Analysis**

Steps to Determine Node Voltages:

1. Select a node as the reference node. Assign voltages v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>n-1</sub> to the remaining n-1 nodes. The voltages are referenced with respect to the reference node.
2. Apply KCL to each of the n-1 nonreference nodes. Use Ohm's law to express the branch currents in terms of node voltages.
