# 电容器和电感器

Capacitors and Inductors

## 电容器和电容

A **capacitor** consists of two conducting plates separated by an insulator (or dielectric).

**Capacitance** is the ratio of the charge on one plate of a capacitor to the voltage difference between the two plates, measured in farads (F).

$$
q = C v
$$

or

$$
C = \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}
$$

where  $A$ is the area of the plates, $d$ is the distance between the plates, and &epsilon; is the dielectric constant of the material between the plates.

**端口特性**

$$
\boxed{i = C \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}}
$$

or

$$
\boxed{v(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int_{t_0}^{t} i(\tau)\, \mathrm{d}\tau + v(t_0)}
$$

**储能**

$$
\boxed{w = \frac{1}{2} C v^2}
$$

## 电感器和电感

An **inductor** consists of a coil of conducting wire.

**Inductance** is the property whereby an inductor exhibits opposition to the change of current flowing through it, measured in henrys (H).

$$
N \Phi = L i
$$

or

$$
L = \frac{N^2\mu A}{l}
$$

where N is the number of turns in the coil, &mu; is the permeability of the core, A is the cross-sectional area of the core, and &ell; is the length of the core.

**端口特性**

$$
\boxed{v = L \frac{\mathrm{d}i}{\mathrm{d}t}}
$$

or

$$
\boxed{i(t) = \frac{1}{L} \int_{t_0}^{t} v(\tau)\, \mathrm{d}\tau + i(t_0)}
$$

**储能**

$$
\boxed{w = \frac{1}{2} L i^2}
